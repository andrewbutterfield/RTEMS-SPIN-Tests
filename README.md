# Promela/SPIN


This directory contains formal models written in Promela and YAML configuration files that point to test-building tools, and the location of the software under test.

Currently this is tailored towards the RTEMS operating system.

**NEW** Added a WP directory to hold material about using weakest-preconditions with RTEMS action-refinement specification items to infer formal API semantics.

## Overview

This repository contains Promela models of various components of [RTEMS](https://www.rtems.org), along with YAML configurations that identify the models, and point at an installation of RTEMS (kept somewhere else).

The  Promela models and supporting material can be found here.

The tools to generate the test, written in Python3, are found in [PromelaTestBuilder](https://github.com/andrewbutterfield/PromelaTestbuilder).

## Testbuilder

### Model Naming

 * We use the same name for model, folder and root. 
 * Names should be kept short (e.g. "mrg" instead of "Manager").
 * We only add "-model" to C sources placed into RTEMS test folders.
 
The names to be used are:

 * Barrier Manager: `barrier-mgr`
 * Chains: `chains`
 * Event Manager: `event-mgr`
 * Message Manager: `msg-mgr`
 * Semaphore Manager: `sem-mgr`
 * Task Manager: `task-mgr`

The role of `models.yml` is now simply to list all the currently available models.

## Model Status

Here we report the current state of the various models,
in order of development. 
The notation [n/N] reports the number of API calls modelled (n) vs. 
the total number of API calls in the manager (N).

### Status of `chains` [2/23]

Was used as an initial trial on how to do test generation.
It only models the unprotected versions of `get` and `append`.
There is no plan to model any more of these, 
as this is really sequential data-manipulation.

### Status of `event-mgr` [2/2]

All API calls have been fully modelled.

### Status of `msg-mgr` [3/11]

Modelled:  `create` `send` `receive`

(! some confusion regarding `construct` and `create`?)

### Status of `barrier-mgr` [5/5]

Seems complete

### Status of `sem-mgr` [7/7]

While all API calls are covered, the full range of options are not.

### Status of `task-mgr` [n/21]

**New** Actively under development

### Status of `proto_sem` [n/a]

This does not models RTEMS APIs, but is used to explore various semantic issues.

**New** Actively under development
